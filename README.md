Aim: To study and implement Operators in C++.

Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz online compiler

Theory: 
Program-1: This program accepts an integer from the user and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.

The user is prompted to enter a number. ->The program uses if, else if, and else statements to check: If the number is greater than 0, it prints "Number is POSITIVE." If the number is less than 0, it prints "Number is NEGATIVE." If the number is equal to 0, it prints "Number is ZERO."

Program-2: This program accepts marks for five subjects, calculates the average, and assigns a grade based on the average score.

The program takes input for five subjects: DCLD, NT, EDC, SnS, and MTT. ->It calculates the average by adding all subject marks and dividing by 5. ->Based on the average, it assigns grades using if-else conditions as follows: O Grade: 90–100 A+ Grade: 80–89 A Grade: 70–79 B Grade: 60–69 C Grade: 50–59 FAIL: Below 50 ->If the calculated average is outside 0–100, it displays an error message to enter valid marks.

Program-3: This program identifies the position of a point (x, y) in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system based on its x and y coordinates.

The program takes two integer inputs: x-coordinate and y-coordinate. ->It then uses if-else conditions to determine the point's location: 1st Quadrant: x > 0 and y > 0. 2nd Quadrant: x < 0 and y > 0. 3rd Quadrant: x < 0 and y < 0. 4th Quadrant: x > 0 and y < 0. On X-axis: y = 0 and x ≠ 0. On Y-axis: x = 0 and y ≠ 0. At Origin: x = 0 and y = 0. ->The program prints the appropriate message indicating the point’s position.

Conclusion: Hence, we used Logical Operators and Relational Operators in the above 3 codes and executed the decision-making statements to get an accurate output.
